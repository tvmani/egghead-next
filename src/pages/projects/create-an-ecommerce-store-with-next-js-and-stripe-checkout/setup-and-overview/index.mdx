Thanks for joining along with this workshop! Whether you're trying to sell something or trying to buy something, ecommerce is an important part of how the world operates. I'm looking forward to taking you through the journey of setting up your own online store to sell your products to the world.

Excited to learn? You should be! Here's some of the stuff we'll learn in this workshop:

- Create a new Next.js app from scratch
- Add and manage a dynamic grid of products
- Set up and configure products in Stripe
- Manage local state with React's useState hook
- Create a custom React hook
- Use the React Context API to manage global state
- Store and persist app state with localstorage
- Integrate Stripe Checkout to let people purchase your products
- Deploy an app to Vercel

## Before the Workshop

#### Environment Requirements

There's also only one thing that is probably considered a "strict" requirement for the workshop, and that is [node](https://nodejs.org/en/). The **operating system** you use shouldn't matter as long as you can run commands with npm (or yarn if that's your thing). If you can run `npm -v`, you should be good to go.

### Setting Up the Project

Once you verified you have all of the environment requirements, we can get started by cloning this repository. **Navigate to the folder you'd like to work in and run:**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/colbyfayock/space-jelly-store-workshop
cd space-jelly-store-workshop
```

All of the lessons are contained in their own individual directory within the [lessons folder](https://github.com/colbyfayock/space-jelly-store-workshop/tree/main/lessons). Each contain's its own set of dependencies (though most are the same) as well as its own project code that we'll use to work through the exercise.

For each lesson, you can start from scratch by navigating to that lesson's directory (`cd lessons/00 - Introduction`) and running:

```shell
npm install
```

This will install all of the required dependencies to get started for the lesson.

### Starting Up the Project

After all of the dependencies are installed for the lesson, you should be good to go! Run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This should kick off a new server available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you've successfully started up your development server, you should be ready to go for the workshop!

### Hints

As you're working through the lesson, you can use designated keys to find locations in the code where changes should be made. These keys can be used by searching for them in your code editor. The keys available are:

- `@lesson-##-todo`
- `@lesson-##-answer`

For example, if we want to find all of the spots where we should be working for lesson 2, we can use the `@lesson-02-todo` key to find those files and locations.

### What to expect from this workshop

Ecommerce places a large role in our day to day lives from buying something silly on Amazon to ordering a prescription that can help you survive. This makes the decisions we make for how we build an app and what kind of experience we provide important.

In this workshop, we'll get started by creating a new app. We'll use Next.js, a React-based web framework, to spin up a new project from scratch that we'll use to create our online store.

Once we have our store ready to go, we'll start adding products that we'll eventually sell to our customers. We'll learn how to manage these products dynamically in a separate file and use those products to build a UI including a homepage with all of our products, a page for each of our products, and a shopping cart page that our customers can use to manage their products.

Through this process, we'll learn core React concepts including how we can use the useState hook to manage app state, what the React Context API is and how we can incorporate it to add a global cart state to our app, and how can we package this all in a custom hook to use anywhere in our app.
